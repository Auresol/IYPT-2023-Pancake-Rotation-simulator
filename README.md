# IYPT 2023 Pancake Rotation simulation
**The most resourse intensive and inaacurate simulation of the IYPT 2023 problem "Pancake Rotation". (Just kidding, it's not that bad)**

This is my personal work on a simulation of the IYPT 2023 problem "Pancake Rotation". The problem statement can be found [here](https://www.iypt.org/problems/problems-for-the-36th-iypt-2023/).

There's many folders in this repository, I can't remember which one does what, I just know that it all work.

## How to run
- Clone the repository
- Run 'autorunner.m' or 'mainsim.m' if autorunner doesn't exist.
- The simulation will run and the results will be displayed in the command window after the simulation is done.
- Most of the experiment variable values can be changed in 'autorunner.m' or 'mainsim.m'. Some parameter like friction coefficient can be changed in 'contactforce_ball.m' or 'contantforce_wall.m', depending on what you want to change.
- Turn off the graphic render by setting ```isrender = false```
